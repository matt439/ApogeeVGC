 * Second character is a source ID, one of:
 *
 * - E = egg, 3rd char+ is the father in gen 2-5, empty in gen 6-7
 *   because egg moves aren't restricted to fathers anymore
 * - S = event, 3rd char+ is the index in .eventData
 * - D = Dream World, only 5D is valid
 * - V = Virtual Console or Let's Go transfer, only 7V/8V is valid
